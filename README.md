# Task-Manager
# Task Manager – A Vanilla JS Productivity App

This project is a **multi-version task manager** built using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It focuses on simplicity, clean UI, and practical interactivity — no frameworks, just code that works.

Each version (tasks 0.html through tasks 14.html and beyond) explores tweaks in UI layout, logic structure, or DOM event handling. It’s part of my journey to master front-end engineering from the ground up.
